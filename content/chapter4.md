# Async/Await in the Wild

Async/await is a powerful tool on its own, but it really shines when combined
with the prolific open source JavaScript ecosystem. It is no secret that
JavaScript was a painful language to work with in 2005, but that pain lead
developers to build an incredible variety of libraries and frameworks to
address common problems.

Now that JavaScript has excellent
features like async/await, these libraries and frameworks are even better.
In this chapter, you'll see how async/await interacts with several common
npm packages. In addition, you'll learn several principles for how to evaluate
what work you need to do to integrate async/await with your favorite libraries
and frameworks.
