# Moving On

Async/await is an exciting new tool that will make JavaScript much easier to
work with.

* An async function always returns a promise.
* `await` pauses an async function until the awaited promise is settled.
* Other JavaScript may run when an async function is paused.
* Error handling is a common problem. Make sure you handle errors with `.catch()`.
