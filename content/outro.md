# Moving On

Async/await is an exciting new tool that makes JavaScript much easier to
work with. It won't solve all your problems, but it will make your day-to-day
much easier by replacing callbacks and promise chaining with `for` loops
and `if` statements. However, in order to work effectively with async/await,
you need to understand the fundamentals. Here are some key points to remember
when working with async/await.

* An async function always returns a promise.
* `await` pauses an async function until the awaited promise is settled.
* Other JavaScript may run when an async function is paused.
* Error handling is a common problem. Make sure you handle errors with `.catch()`.



Congratulations on completing this book, and good luck with your async/await
coding adventures!
